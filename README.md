# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Description
This project is a web application built with **Flask** that predicts whether a credit card transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate** using a trained **machine learning model**. It leverages **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **numpy** to handle data and make predictions in real-time.

The app provides a simple web interface where users can input transaction features and receive an immediate prediction.
